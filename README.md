# PCG Caves and Mazes + PathFinding
Goals of this mini project is to apply the following knowledge I have aquired: 

- C++ Programming
- Basic OpenGL
- Procedural Caves using Cellular Automata
- Mazes using Prims's Algo
- Pathfinding

**Currently only tested for windows**
## About:
This is a simple application that randomly generates caves or a maze[under construction] and allows users to pathfind using A* between two points. The outputs are displayed using opengl. The purpose of this project as stated above was to exercise my understanding of various things I had picked up in classes outside of an academic setting in hopes of better ingraining them into my skillset.
